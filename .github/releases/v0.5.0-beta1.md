## Enhancements

- Audience can now be specified when exchanging client credentials for id/access tokens.
- No longer building a service provider to obtain the configured Identity Server URI - resulting in better startup performance.

## Breaking Changes

- The two token stores used in Brighid Identity are no longer injected into the primary Service Collection, out of concern that they may be used by third-party services to gain access to the tokens.  Both stores, along with their interfaces have also been made internal.
- To clear token caches, a new utility class has been made and injected into the service container (see ICacheUtils/DefaultCacheUtils).
- ClientCredentialsHandler is now an internal class.
- Removed Microsoft.Extensions.Http as a dependency, we are now adding HTTP Clients directly into services ourselves via implementation factories.
